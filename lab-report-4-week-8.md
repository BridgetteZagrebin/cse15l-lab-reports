## Potential Solutions
* Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
* Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
* Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
